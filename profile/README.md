## mkxp-z

mkxp is hard to build. Like, *really* hard, especially if you're using Windows or macOS. As time went on, I kept having to make certain changes to certain libraries, and Apple released its own set of processors, I just gave up trying to rely on system package managers, and just tried to supply scripts in mkxp-z's repository to allow building the dependencies from scratch right on-site.

Almost everything here is only here because either I had to fork them and make edits so that they'd work, or because I'm afraid to use the original repositories from whatever reason. They *are* just forks -- they do not say so because I kept this stuff on Gitlab before, and I've moved them back.
